## Spectral clustering and semi supervised learning
- Explore spectral clustering on a toy dataset (noisymoon), and then extend it to MNIST. 
- Semi-supervised methods and learning in a RKHS (with manifold regularization), including study of stability: 

  - Self Training algorithm
  - Laplacian Regularized Least Squares
  - Laplacian SVM
