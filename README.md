### Course 3
Unsupervised learning, dimension reduction

### Course 4
Tree & ensemble methods: decision/regression trees, ensemble (bagging, random forest, adaboost, gradient boosting, anyboost)

### Course 5
Graphs in ML I: spectral clustering, transductive learning, semi-supervised learning

### Course 6
Graphs in ML II: KNN for collaborative filtering, matrix factorization (with link with PCA, convex formulation & proximal gradient descent), applications to image completion
